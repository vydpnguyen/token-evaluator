To run this project from the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal on your computer.
2. Change directory to where the project is stored using the cd command. Type "cd Projects/" if the project is inside in the "Projects" folder.
3. After being in the project directory, type the command in the terminal to run the project's main file:
python3 main.py --input input.txt --output output.txt

This command will execute the "main.py" file and pass two arguments to it. The "--input" argument specifies the input file name as "input.txt", while the "--output" argument specifies the output file name as "output.txt".
After the command runs, the program will execute and perform the operations defined in the main file. The program's output will be written to the "output.txt" file.
